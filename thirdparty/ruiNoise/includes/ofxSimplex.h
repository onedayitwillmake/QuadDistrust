/*
 this is a port of Karsten Schmidt's perlin noise class for java.
 the original can be found here: code.google.com/p/toxiclibs
 
 i changed a few things and optimized it a little.
 it now uses floats instead of doubles.
 if you have any questions about this port please contact me: ruibmx at gmail dot com
 if you have any questions regarding the original classes please contact Karsten Schmidt.
