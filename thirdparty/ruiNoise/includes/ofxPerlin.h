/*
this is a port of Karsten Schmidt's perlin noise class for java.
the original can be found here: code.google.com/p/toxiclibs
 
i changed a few things and optimized it a little.
one change that i made is that now the noise function returns values in the range -1..1
if you want to get values between 0..1 use the noiseuf(..) functions.
 another thing is that it now uses floats instead of doubles
if you have any questions about this port please contact me: ruibmx at gmail dot com
if you have any questions regarding the original classes please contact Karsten Schmidt.
